#### info...

bdpyweb is a [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) wrapper around [bdpy](https://github.com/Brown-University-Library/borrowdirect.py), a python library for the [BorrowDirect](http://www.borrowdirect.org) api.

note: the requirements.txt [shellvars-py](https://github.com/aneilbaboo/shellvars-py) is not technically necessary for this code to run, but is required for the way we load our environmental variables, and won't hurt anything if not used.
